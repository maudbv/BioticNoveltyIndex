# Biotic Novelty Index: index calculation and simulation

This repository is currently in development by Conrad Schittko and Maud Bernard-Verdier as part of a research project from the BIBS project in Berlin, Germany. This work is part of a manuscript in preparation.

## Content of the repository:

- *FUNCTION BNI.calc.R* : function calculating the Biotic Novelty Index (BNI)
- *FUNCTION BNI simulations.R* : a set of functions to simulate communities and explore the behaviour of the BNI, and two functions for plotting legends on figures
- *data_BNI_simulations.Rdata* : a data file containing all the necessary data to reproduce figures from the article
- *Simulation testing.R* : R script to re-run the 6 different simulation scenarios from the article
- *Simulation BNI.Rmd* : an Rmarkdown document illustrating the simulations in supplementary material 2
